# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:The use of recognised engeneering principles a to create software that is reliable ,efficient and meets specified requiremnets. involves the design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software products.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 1.Traditional programming is primarily focused on writting code while software engeneering is concerned with systematic application of engeneering approaches to the development of software
2 in traditional programming programmers implement have a strong technical skillset in specific programming languages while software engeneering are involved in designing and archetecturing robust software systems 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):Requiremnts
Design 
Implementation 
testing 
deployment 
maintenance 

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.Requiremnts- domenting user needs and system requirements
Design -Creation and archetecture and user interface
Implementation - Writting code and building the software yas per the design
testing -conducting variuos test to ensure quality
deployment -Enabling and realising software to users
maintenance - providing support and updates

Agile vs. Waterfall Models: waterfall is sequential approach with distict phases while agile focused on flexibilty plus collaborations and does not necesarily follow any phases

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Agile can be mostly preffered when a project involves a number of software engeneers while waterfall would be the best when working on your own project
Requirements Engineering:Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.Requirements Engineering:Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Feasiblity study,requirements elicitation and analysis, system modelling,equirents specification,requirement validation
Software Design Principles: Modularity
enscapulation
abstraction
soc separation of concerns
DRY Dont repaet yourself
KISS Keep it simple ,stupid
yagn
SOLID Priciples

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?Break down the system into smaller, independent components (modules). Each module should have a specific purpose and interact with others through well-defined interfaces.

Testing in Software Engineering:Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requiremnts
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?Unit testing
integtation testing
system testing
cceptance testing
Version Control Systems:Software tools for tracking changes to source code and cordinating work among team members
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.1.	Git:
	Features:
	Open-source and distributed.
	Widely used for its speed, flexibility, and robustness.
	Supports branching, merging, and conflict resolution.
	Web based programs like git hub and git bucket.
	Use Cases: Git is the de facto standard in modern software development.
2.	Subversion (SVN):
	Features:
	Centralized version control system.
	Hosts different versions of code in a centralized repository.
	Allows users to access and manage code changes.
	Use Cases: 
3.	Mercurial:
	Features:
	Fast and powerful distributed control.
	Similar to Git but with a simpler command set.
	Ideal for smaller projects or teams.
	Use Cases: Smaller-scale development efforts.
4.	Helix Core (formerly Perforce):
	Features:ï‚§	Provides entire application lifecycle support.
	Includes source code management, project management, reporting, testing, and more.
	Empowers DevOps capabilities.
Software Project Management:crucial dicipline within project managemnt that focuses specifically on planning ,leading,implementing,monitoring and controlling softwae projects
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance: providing ongoing support ,updates ,and enhancement to the software after deployment
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?providing ongoing support ,updates ,and enhancement to the software after deployment crucial dicipline within project managemnt that focuses specifically on planning ,leading,implementing,monitoring and controlling softwae projects
Maintenance activities include conflict ,risk,requirement and change management.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:Fuailure to meet deadlines
technical debts by taking shortcuts
changing requirements

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
technical debt- avoid shortcuts
tight deadlines- plan accordingly and keep time
dont change requiremnts without a proper plan
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
